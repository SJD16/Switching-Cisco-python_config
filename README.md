#Configuration Guide for Cisco Devices Using Python
In this practice, we will demonstrate how to configure Cisco devices (switches and routers) using Python. We will use the telnetlib library to automate the configuration of 4 Cisco switches (3 Layer 2 switches and 1 Layer 3 switch). The goal is to make the network scalable by configuring the following protocols:

    DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol)

    SVI (Switch Virtual Interface)

    EtherChannel

    Telnet

At the end of the configuration, you should be able to perform end-to-end ping tests.
